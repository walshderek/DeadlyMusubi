If you want to replicate my results with my data and settings (for speed and to avoid OOMs), you need to use the musubi-tuner repo from Aug. 15th, before some code changes that altered how Windows manages memory.  The included zip is the repo from that date, untouched.

-------------------------------------------------------

git clone https://github.com/kohya-ss/musubi-tuner.git

cd musubi-tuner

git fetch --all

git checkout e7adb86

python -m venv venv

venv\scripts\activate

pip install -e .

pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128

python versioncheck.py

-------------------------------------------------------

That should be all you need.  Use the models in my configs for best results.

(you will need to paste the absolute path for versioncheck.py OR paste the script itself into your musubi root directory)
