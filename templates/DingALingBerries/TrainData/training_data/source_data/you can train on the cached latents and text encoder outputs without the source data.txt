The files in the /cache folder are the outputs from the VAE and UMT5 encoders... the training data has already been processed and cached there.

My toml points to this cache at the specified location.  Put this cache folder there, and run the launcher.bat.

You do not need the actual training data to train the LoRA, and since the material contains some nsfw photos of real people, I have decided not to tempt the prudes.
